This is the 11th post of a series of blog posts tracking the development and progress of Redox, the Rust operating system. If you want to know more about Redox in general, then visit our [Github page](https://github.com/redox-os/redox).

You might wonder why no update on the progress of Redox OS has appeared over the last couple of weeks. The reason is that we all have been busy with ... being lazy. Nah, just kidding. Actually, we have done _a lot_ of stuff on Redox.

# What's new in Redox?


- [@jackpot51](https://github.com/jackpot51) has added **full blown x86_64 support**. Yay!

- [@eghiorzi](https://github.com/EGhiorzi) has ported his program, 'RUSThello', to Redox. 'RUSThello' is an highly concurrent AI for Reversi (also known as Othello). This demonstrates Redox's multithreading abilities.

- [@ticki](https://github.com/ticki) has started [binutils](https://github.com/redox-os/binutils). `xxd`, `hexdump`, and `strings` are completed.

- Thanks to [@roxxik](https://github.com/roxxik) has made the kernel run in flat real mode, for i386. This means we are now a little closer to adding x86_64 support.

- [@jackpot51](https://github.com/jackpot51) has fixed several bugs in kernel space.

- We are now a few steps farther on the road to full blown `libstd` compatibility. New things ported includes `std::process`, which is still WIP, ([@jackpot51](https://github.com/jackpot51)) `HashMap` ([@ticki](https://github.com/ticki)), `get_current_dir()` ([@k0pernicus](https://github.com/k0pernicus)), `fs::canonicalize` ([@jackpot51](https://github.com/jackpot51)), and much more.

- [@alicemaz](https://github.com/alicemaz) has written a `wc` (behaving like GNU coreutils' `wc`) utility.

- [@ticki](https://github.com/ticki) has rewritten all the Redox coreutils, for faster and more correct code.

- [Sodium](https://github.com/redox-os/sodium) (text editor) and the Redox launcher (`launcher.bin`), [Orbclient](https://github.com/redox-os/orbclient) (display client) now runs on Linux! Thanks to the awesomness of [@jackpot51](https://github.com/jackpot51) and [@stratact](https://github.com/stratact). `orbclient` uses SDL2 as backend on Linux.

- [@skylerberg](https://github.com/skylerberg) has done several changes to Ion (the shell). These includes: a PEG-based parser, directory stacks (popd, pushd, dirs), fork and job control, glob expansion, `cd -`, and much more!

- [@jackpot51](https://github.com/jackpot51) has completely rewritten Orbital. Orbital now runs entirely in userspace, and can be started via a normal executable file, without any assistance from kernel space.

- Thanks to [@jackpot51](https://github.com/jackpot51), we now got proper schemes in userspace!

- [@gmorenz](https://github.com/gmorenz) has improved the multi-cursor feature of Sodium.

- [@jackpot51](https://github.com/jackpot51) has written a very minimal init system.

- And lots of small changes.


# What does it look like?

Someone from the future send it to me. For anyone wondering this is definitely ~~not~~ fake.

This actually happened (believe it or not), while I was hacking on the interrupt handler for x86_64.

OrbTK is a widget toolkit for Orbital, ala GTK.
