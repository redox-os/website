This is the first post in a blog series tracking the development and progress of Redox, the modular and secure OS, written in Rust. So welcome!

# What's new in Redox?

- The development of Redox's package manager, Oxide (`ox` for short), has started. The source for Oxide can be found [here](https://github.com/redox-os/oxide).
- [@jackpot51](https://github.com/jackpot51), [@stratact](https://github.com/stratact), and [@tedsta](https://github.com/tedsta) have started implementing support for ZFS, which is planned to be the main file system used in Redox.
- [@ticki](https://github.com/ticki) made an icon for Redox (see screenshots).
- [@hauleth](https://github.com/hauleth) set up a cool website, using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io).
- [@ticki](https://github.com/ticki) cleaned up the style in the whole codebase.
- [@esell](https://github.com/esell) cargoified a lot of crates in the main repository.

- Thanks to [@stryan](https://github.com/stryan) and [@jackpot51](https://github.com/jackpot51), the window manager is moved to libredox, under the name `orbital`.

# What does it look like?

Yay! Fancy opacity.

We have a file manager!

# What's next?

- Moving many functions out of the kernel/libredox. For example, we plan to move orbital out of libredox.
- Porting libstd completely. Many of the libstd functionalities are provided by the `common` module right now. However, we would like to port libstd to provide support for other crates.
- Adding signatures, hashes, and other crypto stuff to the Oxide package manager.
- Improving documentation.
- Starting a shell (rash).
- Make Redox support 64-bit system.

And lots of lots of lots of other stuff.
