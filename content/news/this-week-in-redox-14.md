This is the 14th post of a series of blog posts tracking the development and progress of Redox, the Rust operating system. If you want to know more about Redox in general, visit our [Github page](https://github.com/redox-os/redox).

Whew, what a long week... ;P

# What's new in Redox?

- [@jackpot51](https://github.com/jackpot51) has replaced the old filesystem with a much faster and better one, supporting memory caching, complete write support, persistent (on-disk) file creation, and efficient (O(1)) renaming. This will act as a temporary replacement for the WIP ZFS support.

- [@ticki](https://github.com/ticki) has added [a new syscall](https://github.com/redox-os/redox/pull/608), `SYS_SUPERVISE` with the purpose of allowing processes to control, sandbox, and supervise their child processes. This acts as a simpler, and yet more expressive, replacement for ptrace. In addition to this new syscall, a new flag to `SYS_CLONE` was added, together with a `spawn_supervised` method on `Command`.

- [@jackpot51](https://github.com/jackpot51) has made `std:net` (almost) on par with the upstream libstd.

- [@ticki](https://github.com/ticki) has completed [ralloc](https://github.com/redox-os/ralloc), the efficient memory allocator of Redox. While it is complete, not all bugs are fixed yet. Supports metacircular reallocation, block queue, efficient inplace reallocation, cache efficient lookups, and memory management debugging.

- [@ticki](https://github.com/ticki) has improved the infrastructure slightly, by creating a new handy [a library](https://github.com/ticki/mars) for making Mattermost/Slack bots, along with [a Rust Playground bot built on it](https://github.com/redox-os/playbot) (Ã  la #rust's `playbot`) and [a few other bots](https://github.com/redox-os/bots).

- [@jackpot51](https://github.com/jackpot51) has moved the filesystem into userspace!

- [@ticki](https://github.com/ticki) has created a new Rust-based build system, [cake](https://github.com/ticki/cake), which will replace Make for building Redox in the near future.

- [@nounoursheureux](https://github.com/nounoursheureux) has added [a better kernel logging system](https://github.com/redox-os/redox/pull/627). This will soon be generalized to userspace logs as well.

- [@wesleywiser](https://github.com/wesleywiser) has added [multiple buffers](https://github.com/redox-os/sodium/pull/40) for Sodium.

- [@jackpot51](https://github.com/jackpot51) is working on DHCP/DNS support.

- [@nounoursheureux](https://github.com/nounoursheureux) has added process-local environment variables.

- [@stratact](https://github.com/stratact) has added menu support to OrbTK.

- [@jackpot51](https://github.com/jackpot51) added a simple initial implementation of `wget`.

- [@ticki](https://github.com/ticki) has added `dem`, a small commandline-based Democracy clone, to `games-for-redox` for fun.

- The kernel now supports basic UDP networking.

- [@nounoursheureux](https://github.com/nounoursheureux) has added `export` to Ion.

- [@mmstick](https://github.com/mmstick) has improved the [implementation of `cat`](https://github.com/redox-os/coreutils/pull/54).

- [@jackpot51](https://github.com/jackpot51) and [@ticki](https://github.com/ticki) have written manpages for most of the tools. The simple [docgen tool](https://github.com/redox-os/redox/commit/4857985d3c4c70421f384624655145ee15980095) is used for the generation of documentation, which is placed in `/refs`.

- ... and many small things.
