On June 21, 2023, the Redox OS nonprofit elected its first Board of Directors.
The Redox OS project is a Unix-like operating system written in Rust, and
intended for free public and commercial use. The nonprofit was formed to
support the project and its community, and will help provide transparency in
the management of funds, hopefully leading to increased donations and the
ability to hire full-time staff.

The Redox OS Board of Directors consists of:

Since starting, he has made vast improvements to the Redox OS documentation and worked on porting numerous programs.
