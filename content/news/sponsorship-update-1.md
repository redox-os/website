This is our first sponsorship report, on these reports we will report our current sponsorship status from companies and funds.

## Radworks

The [Radworks](https://radworks.org/) nonprofit organization sent a donation of 13,000 USD in Ethereum using the [Drips Network](https://drips.network/) to fund the development of the [termion](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/termion) library.

The [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/) project is funded by this organization, it aims to offer a decentralized (peer-to-peer) Git hosting.

Similar to how the BitTorrent protocol works, where people download and upload pieces of files to other people.

## Nlnet

The Nlnet nonprofit organization accepted our proposal to the NGI Zero program to improve the POSIX support on Redox.
