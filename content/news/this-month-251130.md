## How To Test The Changes

To test the changes of this month download the `server` or `desktop` variants of the [daily images](https://static.redox-os.org/img/).

Use the `desktop` variant for a graphical interface. If you prefer a terminal-style interface, or if the `desktop` variant doesn't work, please try the `server` variant.

- If you want to test in a virtual machine use the "harddrive" images
- If you want to test on real hardware use the "livedisk" images

Read the following pages to learn how to use the images in a virtual machine or real hardware:

- [Running Redox in a virtual machine](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/running-vm.html)
- [Running Redox on real hardware](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/real-hardware.html)

Sometimes the daily images are outdated and you need to build Redox from source.
For instructions on how to do this, read the [Building Redox](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/podman-build.html) page.
