Redox OS is a Unix-like general-purpose microkernel-based operating system
written in Rust. February was a very exciting month for Redox! Here's all the latest news.

## FOSDEM 2025

[FOSDEM 2025](https://fosdem.org/2025/) took place in Brussels on Feb. 1 and 2.

Kernel maintainer Jacob Lorentzon (@4lDO2) presented his project [Redox OS Unix-Style Signals](https://nlnet.nl/project/RedoxOS-Signals/),
which is being funded by a grant from [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl/) as part of [NGI Zero Core](https://nlnet.nl/core/).
The presentation took place in the "Microkernel and Component-based OS" room.
A video is not yet available but it will be posted
[on the FOSDEM page for the talk](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5670-posix-signals-in-user-space-on-the-redox-microkernel/)
when it is ready (barring further technical difficulties).

Jacob also presented a brief overview of Redox for those unfamiliar with the project.
The presentation took place in the "Kernel" room.
You can watch [the video here](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5973-redox-os-a-microkernel-based-unix-like-os/).

- Vincent Berthier documented the process to use the Podman build on NixOS

## How To Test The Changes

To test the changes of this month download the `server` or `desktop` variants of the [daily images](https://static.redox-os.org/img/).

(Use the `server` variant for a terminal interface and the `desktop` variant for a graphical interface, if the `desktop` variant doesn't work use the `server` variant)

- If you want to test in a virtual machine use the "harddrive" images
- If you want to test on real hardware use the "livedisk" images

Sometimes the daily images are outdated and you need to build Redox from source, to know how to do this read the [Building Redox](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/podman-build.html) page.
