Hey there everyone! I'm <font color="#fe0000">E</font><font color="#fe8d00">n</font><font color="#ffee00">y</font><font color="#018113">g</font><font color="#014cff">m</font><font color="#8a018b">a</font><font color="#ffabba">t</font><font color="#01cffe">o</font><font color="#6d3407">r</font> ü¶Ä.  

I'm back this year as part of **RSoC (Redox Summer of Code) 2023** to share with you a non-technical post on the **work I'm doing towards improving apps and driver support on Redox OS**!

Feel free to discuss this post on social media. (links are in the Epilogue)

<br/>

I would also like to take this opportunity to wish all the people of this world a Happy <font color="#fe0000">P</font><font color="#fe8d00">R</font><font color="#ffee00">I</font><font color="#018113">D</font><font color="#014cff">E</font> üè≥‚Äçüåà (I know I'm a month late üòÖ).  
Pride is a celebration of who we are, who we love, and the history of our struggle for acceptance. To all the LGBTQ+ people around the world, who face many challenges everyday - I hope that one day, love and peace wins over all the hatred.  
As a queer person, I have found the Redox OS ‚öõ community and the Rust programming language ü¶Ä community to be safe spaces that are really inclusive and welcoming, where I can just be myself; and that just feels so good ü•∞. Thank you all!

## Introduction

The availability of support for various apps and drivers (for various hardware and software) is crucial for the general adoption of any *general purpose operating system* like Redox OS. While many developers are working on improving the *core* of Redox OS (like the Kernel) and native drivers (which is important for the overall goal of Redox OS), I'm taking up the task of **making it easy to use the drivers and apps of other operating systems within Redox OS, by running other OSes in virtual machines and "gluing" them to Redox OS ro ensure a seamless experience**. This will make it much more convenient to use Redox OS as a daily driver. Let me explain...

## Driver Support






## Epilogue

Thank you for reading. I shall be coming back in a few days with a much more _technical_ news post talking about the various ideas in play (to implement app and driver support), the progress made, a few demos to play with, etc. So for those of you who are interested in that, do follow Redox OS on social media and keep an eye out for that *INSIDER* post!

Redox OS Summer of Code is funded by monetary contributions from the community. A big thank you to all of our contributors. You can help us through [donations](https://redox-os.org/donate/).

Thank you. Bye! üíïüíïüíï
