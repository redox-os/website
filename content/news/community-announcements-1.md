This post will cover the important changes for community on this year.

## Matrix

It was decided that Matrix will be our permanent way for communication.

Since January the Redox project was testing Matrix as the new platform for community/development communication, Jeremy Soller migrated to Matrix because of its maturity and popularity.

A Matrix [space](https://matrix.to/#/#redox:matrix.org) for Redox was created with some rooms, more were added over time, you can see the current state below:

- [#redox-join:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#redox-join:matrix.org) - a room to be invited to the Redox space.
- [#redox-general:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#redox-general:matrix.org) - a room for Redox-related discussions (questions, suggestions, porting, etc).
- [#redox-dev:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#redox-dev:matrix.org) - a room for development, here you can talk about anything development-related (code, proposals, achievements, styling, bugs, etc).
- [#redox-support:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#redox-support:matrix.org) - a room for testing/building support (problems, errors, questions).
- [#redox-mrs:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#redox-mrs:matrix.org) - a room to cover all ready merge requests without conflicts  (if you have a ready MR to merge, send there).
- [#redox-board:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#redox-board:matrix.org) - a room for Board of Directors meetings.
- [#redox-voip:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#redox-voip:matrix.org) - a room for voice/video calls.
- [#redox-random:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#redox-random:matrix.org) - a room for off-topic.

Jeremy decided to use the [Rust Code Of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct) as rules for the rooms.

The Redox space is invite-only, every new member must join the "Join Requests" room and request an invite to the Redox space.

Only members of the Redox space can see/join the rooms.

(This system satisfy our needs properly)

The power of all moderators is limited and a room for moderators is available, we discuss moderation-related issues there.

If we have problems with the `matrix.org` instance, probably we can host one using the Synapse server (the same of `matrix.org`) because of its maturity.

Conduit is a Matrix server is written in Rust but is not ready for production use yet.

## Fosstodon

Fosstodon is an alternative for Twitter, we have more control over our content there.

- [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@redox)

We plan to migrate the userbase of Twitter to Fosstodon.

## Lemmy

Lemmy is an FOSS alternative to Reddit, we have more control over our content there.

- [Lemmy](https://lemmy.world/c/redox)

We plan to migrate the userbase of Reddit to Lemmy.
