# What's new in Redox?

## Kernel

- [@ids1024](https://github.com/ids1024) Updated to the new std::ptr API.  Details [here](https://github.com/redox-os/kernel/pull/21).

## Ion

[Ion](https://github.com/redox-os/ion) is a shell for UNIX platforms, and is the default shell in Redox. It is still a work in progress, but much of the core functionality is complete. It is also currently significantly faster than Bash, and even Dash, making it the fastest system shell to date.
