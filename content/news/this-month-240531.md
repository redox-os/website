## COSMIC

COSMIC Files, COSMIC Editor and COSMIC Terminal are now a permanent part of the Redox desktop!
Jeremy has replaced the Orbital file manager, text editor and terminal with their COSMIC counterparts!

We still have a few bugs around exiting the apps, but otherwise, they are working smoothly and they look great!

## Toolchain Update

Our Rust fork was updated to the 2024-05-11 version; it fixed many issues with programs and crates requiring a recent Rust version.

## Self-Hosting Improvements

The native Rust compiler port was updated to match our Rust cross-compiler version, improving the self-hosting support.

We also updated our LLVM native port to use the LLVM version from our native Rust compiler fork (18.1.4).

## Mesa3D Update

Our Mesa3D fork was updated to the 24.0.8 version, the latest stable.

## Programs

Ribbon packaged more programs as usual, many utilities and Cargo tools.

He also packaged exciting projects like [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/) and the [Sequoia-PGP](https://sequoia-pgp.org/) tools.
