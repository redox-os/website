## Trying out Redox

Trying out Redox is very easy: just follow the instructions in the [Redox Book](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/trying-out-redox.html). Running Redox on real machines is possible, but the performance may vary. Please check out the [supported machines](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redox/-/blob/master/HARDWARE.md) for more information.

## Building Redox

Building Redox from source code is supported on Linux, and may work on some other platforms, but is not currently supported on Windows. To build Redox read [this](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/podman-build.html) page.
