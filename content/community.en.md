This page attempts to explain how the Redox OS community is organised and help you navigate it.


<a id="chat"></a>
## [Chat](https://matrix.to/#/#redox:matrix.org)

Matrix is currently being evaluated for use as the official Redox OS chatroom.

## [Mattermost](https://chat.redox-os.org)

Until recently, we have been using a Mattermost chat server, which we are currently maintaining for historical purposes. Contact us on Redox OS/General if you need access to the Mattermost server.

<a id="gitlab"></a>
## [GitLab](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redox)

A bit more formal way of communication with fellow Redox devs, but a little less quick and convenient like the chat. Submit an issue when you run into problems compiling, testing, or just would like to discuss a certain topic, be it features, code style, code inconsistencies, minor changes and fixes, etc.

<a id="forum"></a>
## [Forum](https://discourse.redox-os.org/)

This is the best way to discuss more general topics that aren't about specific things that need to be addressed one way or another. You can sign up like any other website.

<a id="reddit"></a>
## [Redox OS on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Redox/)

If you want a quick look at what's going on and talk about it.

[reddit.com/r/rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust) for related Rust news and discussions.
